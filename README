-------------------------------------------------
---         Notes 			    -----
-------------------------------------------------
Git workflow. We are managing several releases of the firstdata plugin for payplans. This is mainly because every site we install it on has different requirements for their form, and stlying. 
As such, every site site install is a persistant branch off of master. (DO NOT MERGE SITE BRANCHES BACK INTO MASTER). Core updates to the functionality and logic will be made to the master 
and merged up to each site install branch.


--------------------------------------------------
-------    Install:                          -----
--------------------------------------------------
Install as you would any other Joomla component, by going to extentions>add new.

Once the plugin is installed you will need to instantiate it from within payplans. Go to the apps tab within payplans and click the new button
yoursite + index.php?option=com_payplans&view=app

Select the firstdata app in create an instance of it. This will take you a configuraion page where you can select payplans specific settings and your firstdata settings which I will explain 1 by 1 below

Store Name: The store id provided by firstdata

Shared Secret: The shared secret provided by firstdata. Log in to firstdata and go to admin>connect2.0 settings to generate a shared secret.

Pay Mode: Select the payment mode you wish to use. (currently payonly mode is the only option supported)
	PayOnly - firstdata collects minimum amount of data inorder to complete the transaction
	PayPlus - Collects the same as PayOnly as well as billing informaiton
	FullPay - Collect the same as PayOnly as well as shipping address

Test: Determines wheather to use the firstdata sandbox processing or live process. WARNING testing in live processing can lead to transaction fees even if you delete the transactions later.

Allow recurring cancel: This option must be set if you want your users to be able to cancel their subscriptions.
